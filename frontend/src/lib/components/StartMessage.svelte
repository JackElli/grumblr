			This is the place to rant about anything on your mind. There's too much negative negativity on
			other platforms, let's make this the place to be positively negative.

			With that said, we don't want grumblr to be a place to be hurtful or discriminitory, only a
			place to let off some steam. We hope you can let your grumbly imagination run wild here and if
			you should have any feedback / things you would like to see on grumblr, do not hesitate to get
			in touch,
